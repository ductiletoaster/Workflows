# Workflows

This project is an attempt to bring order to my diverse software interests. In this project you will find a collection of docker [services](./services/README.md) ranging in interests from AI to Media serving and more. My focus is in creating a simple to use and familiar (to me) set of workflows for developing applications and leveraging state of the art technology to do so. 

In the future you can expect to see me introduce more robust tooling to help support development of applications. My aim is not to necessary revent the wheel but instead use common well established technologies to create a fun to use solution to meet my needs.
