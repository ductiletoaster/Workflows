# Ideas
- Could create GIT post clone/pull scripts to setup the repo
- https://goharbor.io/docs/2.13.0/install-config/ for my own image repo
- Follow advice [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/152onud/can_i_have_a_domain_name_redirect_to_a_local/) to create local domains
- https://github.com/gregoryca/traefik/tree/master



### Moving to Swarm
1) I shoudl rebuild the nas with proper SSD / HDD setup
2) Setup other computer as workstation-02
3) Document all steps
4) Libre and Portainer agent are not showing in traefik maybe because they are not visible on the manager?
